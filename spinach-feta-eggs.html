      <h2>Recipe Details</h2>
      <p>
        Whip up eggs with a few simple ingredients in a microwave-safe mug, and you have the makings of a breakfast that’s prepped, seasoned, and ready to eat in a little more than a minute before running out the door.
      </p>

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>8 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup half-and-half</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped baby spinach</li>
        <li>1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill, plus more for garnish</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Directions</h3>
      <p>
        Coat 4 (12-ounce) microwave-safe mugs with cooking spray. Crack 2 eggs into each prepared mug. Add 1 tablespoon half-and-half to each; whisk with a fork until completely blended. Add 2 tablespoons spinach, 1 tablespoon feta, and 1½ teaspoons dill to each mug, stirring until combined. Sprinkle with salt. Cover and refrigerate for up to 4 days.
      </p>
      <p>
        When ready to eat, uncover a mug and microwave on High, stirring every 15 to 20 seconds, until set, 1 minute and 15 seconds to 1 minute and 25 seconds for large curds (about 1 minute for soft-scramble). Stir with a fork to create fluffy curds. Sprinkle with additional dill, if desired.
